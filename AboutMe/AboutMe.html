    <h2>Reflection about my school life</h2>
  <p>I am taking this web design course. This was my third year learning coding. Most of the time, I believed I would fall behind, but as I started this course, I realized it wasn't that difficult. At first, I felt this subject was challenging, but as I started studying the fundamentals, I believed I could succeed. I have accomplished learning how to make websites, games, animations, with CSS, HTML, and Javascript. I also learned basics of python and jQuery. I still have so much more to learn about coding.  I am also in a club which is called, honors society.

  <h2>Family Life</h2>
<p>My brothers and me were always so close, especially my twin brother. I always copied and followed him until highschool hit. We both walked different paths but still are one. When we hangout, we go to restauranats we eat and talk with our parents. During the summer we travel places, like we have went to Canada, Indiana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, India, and many amusement parks.I love spending time with my family, I can be myself around them.
